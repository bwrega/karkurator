## How to use this project for learning programming

You can learn how the program works and extend it.

Here are some ideas for what can you do here:

### Implement subtraction and multiplication

See how does adding and division work - and implement subtraction and multiplication.

### Change display font

Change font used for "display" to something that looks like an LCD display.

### Random colors on button press

Implement such behaviour, that when any button is clicked - all elements get random colors.
Those random colors may be selected from a pre selected palette.

### Implement memory

Implement calculator memory (buttons M+, MR, MC on a normal calculator).
